# Colony-Counter
Calculates kill curve for cells in a colony assay, 2014
In high school I spent summers as a student intern at Fox Chase Cancer Center. When when of my tasks became counting cell colonies manually I noticed how it could much more efficiently done by a computer considering the plates were already scanned into the computer for records. I spent several weeks developing this counter as a side project and got input from the people I worked with as I made it.
